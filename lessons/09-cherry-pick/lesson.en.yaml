      In this lesson you will cherry-pick a specific commit from a
      feature branch to the main branch.

      The repository has two branches:
        - main: contains only the initial commit
        - feature/mixed-work: contains 3 commits
            1. "experiment: try new approach"  (creates experiment.js)
            2. "feat: add utility functions"   (creates utils.js)
            3. "experiment: continue testing"  (modifies experiment.js)

      You want ONLY the "feat: add utility functions" commit on main.
      The experimental commits should NOT be brought over.

      How to cherry-pick in lazygit:
        1. Go to the Branches panel (press 3)
        2. Navigate to "feature/mixed-work" and press Enter
           to view its commits
        3. Find the "feat: add utility functions" commit
        4. Press Shift+C (uppercase C) to copy the commit
           for cherry-picking
        5. Press Escape to go back to the Branches panel
        6. Make sure you are on the main branch
           (select it and press Space to checkout if needed)
        7. Press Shift+V (uppercase V) to paste (apply)
           the cherry-picked commit

      Your task:
        Cherry-pick ONLY the "feat: add utility functions" commit
        from feature/mixed-work to main. After completing:
        - utils.js should exist on main
        - experiment.js should NOT exist on main
        - feature/mixed-work branch should still exist
    hints:
      - "Press 3 to go to the Branches panel"
      - "Select feature/mixed-work and press Enter to see its commits"
      - "Navigate to 'feat: add utility functions' and press Shift+C to copy"
      - "Press Escape to return to Branches, ensure you are on main"
      - "Press Shift+V to paste the cherry-picked commit onto main"
      - "Only the utils.js file should appear on main, not experiment.js"
