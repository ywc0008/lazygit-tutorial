      In this lesson you will learn how to stage only part of a file's
      changes using lazygit's patch building feature.

      The file app.js has been modified in two separate sections:
        - Section A (User Management): added console.log lines
        - Section B (Product Management): added console.log lines

      Your task is to commit ONLY the User Management changes
      (Section A) while leaving the Product Management changes
      (Section B) unstaged.

      How to partially stage in lazygit:
        1. Go to the Files panel (press 2)
        2. Select app.js and press Enter to view the diff
        3. You will see the changes split into hunks
        4. Navigate to the hunk containing "Getting user" /
           "Deleting user" changes
        5. Press Space to stage that hunk
        6. Do NOT stage the hunk with "Getting product" /
           "Deleting product" changes
        7. Press Escape to go back to the Files panel
        8. Commit with a message containing the word "user"
           (e.g., "Add logging for user operations")

      After committing, only the user-related console.log lines
      should be in the commit. The product-related changes should
      remain as unstaged modifications.
    hints:
      - "Press 2 to go to the Files panel"
      - "Select app.js and press Enter to see the diff hunks"
      - "Use arrow keys to navigate between hunks"
      - "Press Space on a hunk to stage just that hunk"
      - "Only stage the hunks related to User Management (Section A)"
      - "Press Escape to return, then commit with a message containing 'user'"
