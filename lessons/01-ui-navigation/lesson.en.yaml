      Welcome to lazygit! In this lesson you will explore the interface.

      lazygit has 5 main panels:
        1. Status   - shows repo name and current branch
        2. Files    - shows changed files (staged / unstaged)
        3. Branches - lists local and remote branches
        4. Commits  - shows commit history
        5. Stash    - shows stashed changes

      Navigation basics:
        - Press Tab or number keys (1-5) to switch between panels
        - Use arrow keys (Up/Down) to select items within a panel
        - Press Enter to view details of the selected item
        - Press q to quit lazygit

      Your task:
        Open lazygit and visit each panel. Look at the files,
        branches, and commits that have been set up for you.
        When you are done exploring, quit with q.
    hints:
      - "Press Tab to cycle through panels, or press 1-5 to jump directly"

      - "The Commits panel shows 3 commits on main"
      - "Press q to quit when you are done"
