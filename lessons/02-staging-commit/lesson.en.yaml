      In this lesson you will stage files and create a commit.

      Your working directory has 3 changes waiting:
        - app.js    (modified - new functions added)
        - index.html (modified - footer added)
        - style.css  (new untracked file)

      How to stage and commit in lazygit:
        1. Go to the Files panel (press 2 or Tab)
        2. Stage files:
           - Press Space on a file to stage/unstage it individually
           - Press a to stage ALL files at once
        3. Commit:
           - Press c to open the commit message editor
           - Type a message that contains the word "first"
             (e.g., "first feature commit")
           - Press Enter to confirm the commit

      Your task:
        Stage all 3 files and create a commit. The commit message
        must contain the word "first" (case-insensitive).
    hints:

      - "Press a to stage all files at once"
