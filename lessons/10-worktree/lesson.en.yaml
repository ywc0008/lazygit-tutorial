  - id: create-worktree
    instruction: |
      In this lesson you will create a git worktree to work on
      multiple branches simultaneously without switching.

      The repository has two branches:
        - main (current): the main development branch
        - hotfix/urgent-bug: a branch for an urgent fix

      Normally you would switch branches to work on the hotfix,
      but that disrupts your current work. With worktrees, you
      can check out the hotfix branch in a separate directory
      and work on both at the same time.

      How to create a worktree in lazygit:
        1. Go to the Branches panel (press 3)
        2. Navigate to "hotfix/urgent-bug"
        3. Press w to create a worktree for this branch
        4. lazygit will prompt for a path - confirm or customize
           the worktree directory location
        5. The worktree will be created, checking out the branch
           in a separate directory

      Benefits of worktrees:
        - No need to stash or commit incomplete work
        - Run builds on one branch while editing another
        - Quick context switching for urgent fixes
        - Each worktree has its own working directory
        - lazygit can switch between worktrees seamlessly

      Your task:
        Create a worktree for the "hotfix/urgent-bug" branch.
        After completing, `git worktree list` should show at
        least 2 worktrees (the main one and the new one).
    hints:
      - "Press 3 to go to the Branches panel"
      - "Navigate to 'hotfix/urgent-bug' in the branch list"
      - "Press w to open the worktree creation dialog"
      - "Confirm the path when prompted to create the worktree"
      - "After creation, git worktree list should show 2 entries"

  - id: remove-worktree
    instruction: |
      You have successfully created a worktree!

      Once you are done with the hotfix work, you should remove
      the worktree to keep things tidy. Leaving unused worktrees
      around wastes disk space and can cause confusion.

      How to remove a worktree in lazygit:
        1. Go to the Branches panel (press 3)
        2. Press w to open the worktree menu
        3. Select the worktree you want to remove
        4. Press d to remove it

      Alternatively, you can remove it from the terminal:
        git worktree remove <worktree-path>

      Your task:
        Remove the worktree you created. After completing,
        `git worktree list` should show only the main worktree
        (1 entry).
    hints:
      - "Press w in the Branches panel to see the worktree list"
      - "Select the worktree to remove and press d"
      - "Or use git worktree remove from the terminal"
      - "After removal, git worktree list should show only 1 entry"
