      In this lesson you will learn how to configure lazygit custom
      commands to add your own keyboard shortcuts.

      A lazygit config file has been prepared at:
        .config/lazygit/config.yml

      It contains a commented-out custom command template that
      creates an annotated git tag. Your task:

        1. Open the config file and uncomment the customCommands
           section. The command binds the "T" key in the commits
           context to create an annotated tag with a user-provided
           name.

        2. After editing the config, reload lazygit (or restart it)
           so the custom command takes effect.

        3. Go to the Commits panel (press 4), select a commit,
           and press T to trigger your custom command.

        4. When prompted for a tag name, enter: v1.0

      The custom command template uses lazygit's prompt system:
        - key: "T"              — the keyboard shortcut
        - command: "git tag..." — the shell command to run
        - context: "commits"    — only available in commits panel
        - prompts:              — input forms shown before running

      Note: For this tutorial exercise, you can also create the
      tag directly using git commands if you prefer. The key
      learning is understanding how custom commands work.
    hints:
      - "Edit .config/lazygit/config.yml to uncomment the customCommands section"
      - "Remove the '# ' prefix from each line in the customCommands block"
      - "Make sure the YAML indentation is correct after uncommenting"
      - "Restart lazygit to load the new config"
      - "In the Commits panel, press T and enter 'v1.0' as the tag name"
      - "Alternatively: git tag -a v1.0 -m 'v1.0' to create the tag directly"

  - id: create-second-tag
    instruction: |
      You have successfully created the v1.0 tag!

      Now that you are familiar with using custom commands, create
      a second tag using the same method. This time, create a v2.0
      tag on the latest commit.

      Your task:
        1. Select the latest commit in the Commits panel
        2. Use the custom command (T) or a git command to create
           a v2.0 annotated tag

      After completing, both v1.0 and v2.0 tags should exist.

      Tip: By reusing the custom command you configured, you can
      see how useful lazygit custom commands are in real workflows.
    hints:
      - "Go to Commits panel (press 4) and select the latest commit"
      - "Press T to run the custom tag creation command"
      - "Enter 'v2.0' as the tag name"
      - "Alternatively: git tag -a v2.0 -m 'v2.0' to create the tag directly"
