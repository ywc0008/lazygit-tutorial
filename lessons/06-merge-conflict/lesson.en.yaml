      In this lesson you will merge a branch that conflicts with main
      and resolve the conflict using lazygit.

      The setup:
        - You are on the "main" branch
        - A "feature/friendly-greeting" branch exists with different
          changes to the same lines in greeting.txt
        - Merging will cause a conflict

      How to merge and resolve:
        1. Go to the Branches panel (press 3 or Tab until you reach it)
        2. Select "feature/friendly-greeting"
        3. Press M (uppercase) to merge it into the current branch (main)
        4. A conflict will appear — go to the Files panel (press 2 or Tab)
        5. Select the conflicting file (greeting.txt)
        6. Press Enter to open the conflict resolution view
        7. Navigate the conflict sections with arrow keys
           and press Space to pick the version you want,
           or press b to pick both versions
        8. Alternatively, press e to open an editor and resolve manually
        9. After resolving, go back to Files panel,
           press Space to stage the resolved file
       10. Press c to create the merge commit

      Your task:
        Merge feature/friendly-greeting into main and resolve all
        conflicts. The final content of greeting.txt can be whichever
        version you choose — just make sure no conflict markers remain.
    hints:
      - "Go to Branches panel with 3 or Tab"
      - "Select feature/friendly-greeting and press M (uppercase, Shift+m) to merge"
      - "After the conflict, go to Files panel and select greeting.txt"
      - "Press Enter on the conflicting file to see the conflict view"
      - "Use Space to pick a side, or press e to edit manually"
      - "After resolving, press Space to stage the file, then c to commit"

  - id: delete-merged-branch
    instruction: |
      You have successfully resolved the merge conflict!

      After a merge is complete, it is good practice to delete the
      feature branch that is no longer needed. This keeps your branch
      list clean and organized.

      How to delete a branch in lazygit:
        1. Go to the Branches panel (press 3 or Tab)
        2. Select "feature/friendly-greeting"
        3. Press d to delete the branch
        4. Confirm the deletion when prompted

      Notes:
        - Only delete branches that have been merged. Deleting
          unmerged branches could result in lost work
        - You cannot delete the currently checked-out branch
        - lazygit will warn you if you try to delete an unmerged branch

      Your task:
        Delete the "feature/friendly-greeting" branch. After
        completing, the branch should no longer appear in the
        branch list.
    hints:
      - "Press 3 to go to the Branches panel"
      - "Select feature/friendly-greeting"
      - "Press d to delete the branch"
      - "Confirm the deletion when prompted"
