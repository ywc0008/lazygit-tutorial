      In this lesson you will clean up a messy commit history using
      interactive rebase.

      The repository currently has 6 commits:
        1. Initial commit
        2. feat: add feature A
        3. fix typo in feature A        (should be squashed into #2)
        4. feat: complete feature A
        5. remove debug code            (should be squashed into #4)
        6. feat: add feature B

      Commits #3 and #5 are cleanup commits that should be merged
      into their parent feature commits.

      How to interactive rebase in lazygit:
        1. Go to the Commits panel (press 4)
        2. Navigate to the oldest commit you want to modify
           (e.g., "feat: add feature A")
        3. Press e to start interactive rebase from that commit
        4. Now you are in rebase mode. For each commit you want
           to squash:
           - Navigate to the commit (e.g., "fix typo in feature A")
           - Press s to squash it (merges into previous commit,
             combines messages)
           - Or press f to fixup (merges into previous commit,
             discards this commit's message)
        5. If needed, reorder commits with ctrl+j / ctrl+k
           so the cleanup commit is right after its parent
        6. When done, continue the rebase by pressing m to
           bring up rebase options, then select "continue"

      Your task:
        Squash or fixup the "fix typo in feature A" and
        "remove debug code" commits into their respective parent
        feature commits. The final history should have 4 or fewer
        commits, and all files (README.md, feature.js, feature-b.js)
        must still exist.
    hints:
      - "Press 4 to go to the Commits panel"
      - "Navigate to 'feat: add feature A' and press e to start rebase"
      - "In rebase mode, move to 'fix typo in feature A' and press s or f"
      - "Similarly squash 'remove debug code' into 'feat: complete feature A'"
      - "Use ctrl+j / ctrl+k to reorder commits if needed"
      - "Press m for rebase options, then continue to finish"
