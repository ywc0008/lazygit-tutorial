      In this lesson you will learn to stash your work-in-progress
      and restore it later.

      The setup:
        - You are on the "main" branch with uncommitted changes:
          app.js has been modified and temp-notes.txt is a new file
        - A "release" branch also exists

      Why stash?
        Sometimes you need to switch branches or pull changes, but you
        have uncommitted work. Stashing saves your changes temporarily
        so you can come back to them later.

      How to stash in lazygit:
        - In the Files panel, press s (lowercase) to stash all changes
        - You can type a stash message or just press Enter for the default

      Your task:
        Stash your current changes. After stashing, your working
        directory should be completely clean (no modified or untracked files).
    hints:
      - "Make sure you are in the Files panel (press 2 or Tab)"
      - "Press s (lowercase) to stash all changes"
      - "Enter a descriptive name or just press Enter for the default"
      - "After stashing, the Files panel should be empty"

  - id: pop-stash
    instruction: |
      Your changes are safely stashed. The working directory is clean.

      Now restore your changes by popping the stash.

      How to pop stash in lazygit:
        - Go to the Stash panel (press 5, or Tab until you reach it)
        - Select the stash entry
        - Press g (lowercase) to pop — this restores the changes AND
          removes the stash entry
        - Note: pressing Space would apply the stash (restore changes)
          but keep the stash entry for later use

      Your task:
        Pop the stash to restore your changes. After popping, your
        files should be back (app.js modified, temp-notes.txt present)
        and the stash list should be empty.
    hints:
      - "Press 5 or Tab to navigate to the Stash panel"
      - "Select the stash entry with arrow keys"
      - "Press g (lowercase) to pop the stash"
      - "Do NOT use Space — that applies without removing the stash entry"
      - "After popping, check that Files panel shows your changes again"

  - id: named-stash

      You have learned the basics of stashing and popping. Now let's
      practice creating a named stash.

      Adding a descriptive name to your stash makes it easier to find
      the right stash entry later when you have multiple stashes.

      Your working directory currently has modified files. This time,
      create a stash with a name that contains the word "health".

      How to create a named stash in lazygit:
        1. Go to the Files panel (press 2)
        2. Press s to create a stash
        3. Type a descriptive name in the prompt
           (e.g., "health check feature WIP")
        4. Press Enter to confirm

      Your task:
        Stash your changes with a name containing "health".
        After stashing, your working directory should be clean.
    hints:
      - "Press s in the Files panel to create a stash"
      - "Type a message containing 'health' in the stash name prompt"
      - "For example: 'health check feature WIP'"
      - "After stashing, the Files panel should be empty"
