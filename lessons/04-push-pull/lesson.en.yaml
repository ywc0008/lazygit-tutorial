    instruction: |
      In a team, others push changes that you need to pull down.

      This scenario simulates a remote repository. A colleague has
      pushed a commit with "colleague.js" that you do not have yet.
      You also have a local commit with "myfile.js" that the remote
      does not have.

      How to pull in lazygit:
        - Press p (lowercase) anywhere to pull from the remote

      Note: lazygit may ask you to choose a pull strategy
      (merge, rebase, etc.). Choose the default or "merge" option.

      Your task:
        Pull the remote changes so that "colleague.js" appears
        in your working directory.
    hints:
      - "Press p (lowercase) to pull"
      - "If prompted for a strategy, select merge (or press Enter for default)"
      - "After pulling, you should see colleague.js in your file listing"
      - "Check the Commits panel - you should see both your commit and the colleague's commit"

      Now push your local commits to the remote so your colleague
      can see your work too.

      How to push in lazygit:
        - Press P (uppercase / Shift+P) anywhere to push to the remote

      Your task:
        Push your changes to the remote repository.
    hints:
      - "Press P (Shift+P, uppercase) to push"
      - "After pushing, the remote should have all your commits"
      - "If push fails, make sure you pulled first (previous step)"
