      In this lesson you will learn to view diffs and stage files selectively.

      Two files have been modified: app.js and config.json.

      Viewing diffs:
        - In the Files panel, use Up/Down to select a file
        - The right side automatically shows the diff for the selected file
        - Select app.js to see its changes — notice it has TWO separate
          hunks (groups of changes): one in the Auth section and one in
          the Data Processing section

      Selective staging:
        - Press Space on a file to stage ONLY that file
        - Press Tab to switch between the Unstaged and Staged sections

      Your task:
        Select app.js and view its diff. Then stage ONLY app.js
        (do NOT stage config.json). Commit with a message that
        contains the word "partial".
    hints:
      - "Use arrow keys in the Files panel to select app.js"
      - "Press Space to stage the selected file"
      - "Press Tab to see your staged files vs unstaged files"
      - "After staging app.js, press c to open the commit dialog"
      - "Type a message containing 'partial', e.g. 'partial: update app logic'"

  - id: commit-remaining
    instruction: |
      Good — you committed app.js while leaving config.json unstaged.

      Now finish up by staging and committing the remaining changes.

      Your task:
        Stage config.json and commit it with any message you like.
        After this, your working directory should be completely clean.
    hints:
      - "Select config.json in the Files panel and press Space to stage it"
      - "Press c to commit, then type your message and confirm"
      - "After committing, the Files panel should be empty"
