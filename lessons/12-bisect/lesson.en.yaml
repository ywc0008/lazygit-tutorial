      In this lesson you will use git bisect to find which commit
      introduced a bug. The repository has 8 commits (v1 through v8).
      One of these commits added the line "BUG_INTRODUCED" to app.js.

      Your task is to use lazygit's bisect feature to find the
      exact commit that introduced the bug.

      How to check if a commit is "bad":
        Look at app.js — if it contains "BUG_INTRODUCED", the
        commit is bad. If it does not, the commit is good.

      How to bisect in lazygit:
        1. Go to the Commits panel (press 4)
        2. Navigate to the latest commit (v8) — this is the
           known "bad" commit since the bug exists now
        3. Press b to mark it as bad and start bisect
        4. Navigate to the oldest commit (v1) — this is the
           known "good" commit (no bug existed then)
        5. Press b to mark it as good
        6. Git will now checkout a middle commit for you to test
        7. Check app.js to see if "BUG_INTRODUCED" exists:
           - If yes: press b to mark as bad
           - If no: press b to mark as good
        8. Repeat step 7 until git identifies the first bad commit

      The bisect will narrow down to the commit that introduced
      the bug through binary search (testing ~3 commits instead
      of all 8).
    hints:
      - "Press 4 to go to the Commits panel"
      - "Navigate to v8 (latest) and press b to mark as bad"
      - "Navigate to v1 (oldest) and press b to mark as good"
      - "Git checks out a middle commit — look at app.js for 'BUG_INTRODUCED'"
      - "Press b to mark each tested commit as good or bad"
      - "The bug was introduced in the v5 commit"
