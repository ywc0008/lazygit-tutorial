  - id: bisect-find-bug
    instruction: |
      In this lesson you will use git bisect to find which commit
      introduced a bug. The repository has 8 commits (v1 through v8).
      One of these commits created a file called config.js containing
      the text "BUG_INTRODUCED".

      Your task is to use lazygit's bisect feature to find the
      exact commit that introduced the bug.

      How to check if a commit is "bad":
        Look at config.js — if it exists and contains "BUG_INTRODUCED",
        the commit is bad. If config.js does not exist, the commit is good.

      How to bisect in lazygit:
        1. Go to the Commits panel (press 4)
        2. Navigate to the latest commit (v8) — this is the
           known "bad" commit since the bug exists now
        3. Press b to mark it as bad and start bisect
        4. Navigate to the oldest commit (v1) — this is the
           known "good" commit (no bug existed then)
        5. Press b to mark it as good
        6. Git will now checkout a middle commit for you to test
        7. Check if config.js exists and contains "BUG_INTRODUCED":
           - If yes: press b to mark as bad
           - If no: press b to mark as good
        8. Repeat step 7 until git identifies the first bad commit

      The bisect will narrow down to the commit that introduced
      the bug through binary search (testing ~3 commits instead
      of all 8).
    hints:
      - "Press 4 to go to the Commits panel"
      - "Navigate to v8 (latest) and press b to mark as bad"
      - "Navigate to v1 (oldest) and press b to mark as good"
      - "Git checks out a middle commit — check if config.js exists and contains 'BUG_INTRODUCED'"
      - "Press b to mark each tested commit as good or bad"
      - "The bug was introduced in the v5 commit"

  - id: revert-bug-commit
    instruction: |
      You found the bug commit with bisect! Now it's time to fix it.

      After bisect completes, you need to first end (reset) the
      bisect session, then revert the buggy commit.

      Your task:
        1. End the bisect session
           - lazygit: press b in Commits panel to reset bisect
           - Or terminal: git bisect reset
        2. Revert the commit that introduced the bug (v5)
           - lazygit: select the v5 commit in Commits panel,
             press t to revert
           - Or terminal: git revert <commit-hash>

      After completing:
        - bisect should be inactive
        - config.js should no longer exist
        - A revert commit should exist

      Note: bisect reset returns HEAD to its original position
      (v8). Then you can run the revert.
    hints:
      - "First end bisect: press b in Commits panel → reset, or git bisect reset"
      - "Find the v5 commit and press t to revert it"
      - "Or use git revert <v5 commit hash>"
      - "After completing, config.js should no longer exist"
