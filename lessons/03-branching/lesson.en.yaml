      Branches let you work on features without affecting the main code.

      The repo currently has 3 commits on the main branch.

      How to create and switch branches in lazygit:
        1. Go to the Branches panel (press 3 or Tab)
        2. Press n to create a new branch
        3. Type "feature" as the branch name and press Enter
           - lazygit automatically switches to the new branch

      Your task:
        Create a new branch called "feature" and make sure
        you are on it (HEAD should point to "feature").
    hints:
      - "Press 3 to go to the Branches panel"
      - "Press n to create a new branch"
      - "Type exactly 'feature' and press Enter"
      - "The branch indicator at the top should show 'feature'"

      Now you are on the "feature" branch. Make a change and commit it.

      You can edit files in any way you like:
        - Modify an existing file (app.js, utils.js, or README.md)
        - Or create a new file

      Steps in lazygit:
        1. First, edit a file outside lazygit (use your editor or terminal)
           - Or press e on a file in the Files panel to edit it
        2. Go to the Files panel (press 2)
        3. Stage the changed file (Space or a)
        4. Commit with c, type a message, and press Enter

      Your task:
        Make any change to the repo and create a commit on
        the "feature" branch.
    hints:
      - "You can press e on a file to open it in your editor"
      - "Or quit lazygit (q), edit a file in terminal, then reopen lazygit"
      - "After editing, go to Files panel (2), stage with Space, commit with c"
      - "Any commit message is fine for this step"
